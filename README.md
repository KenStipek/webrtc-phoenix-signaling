# Elixir based WebRTC Peer-to-peer signaling server #
> Using Phoenix Channels

## Project ## 
This is an example of a Elixir based Phoenix WebRTC signaling server that helps two or more WebRTC clients _(say, browsers or mobile apps)_ negotiate for a direct WebRTC connection.

WebRTC is a standard which allows peers to transmit real-time information directly between them without having to rely on servers. Basically, all direct video and voice call apps work like this.

## Progress ##
The project is in progress. 

## Currently working: ##
* Single room live WebRTC P2P negotiation with 2 peers
* REST API authentication and authorization that will block 3rd party clients
* Message broadcasting between clients without using WebRTC data channels _(using Phoenix Channels instead)_
* Handling entrance and closing diffs via Phoenix Presence module

## Install & Setup ##
The current setup does not rely on any external database, it maintains all data in transient state.

### To install: ###
Make sure you have the latest Elixir & Erlang versions installed. Then:

```
mix deps.get
```

run:
```
mix phx.server
```

run in interactive Elixir shell:
```
iex -S mix phx.server
```

check REST API routes:
```
mix phx.routes
```

## Under development: ##
* Maintaining peer negotiation state at GenServer and/or Phoenix Presence module
* Creating proper fallback methods for 
* Expanding channels and routes to a multi-channel infrastructure with automatic redirecting
* Optimizing supervisor tree for more robust deployment
* Writing proper documentation and tests, so that all documentation can be generated by Elixir docs
* Writing deployment instructions
* Redundant code cleanup & codebase improved structuring
* _(Adding Ecto models for PostgreSQL to maintain permanent nicknames and avatars)_
